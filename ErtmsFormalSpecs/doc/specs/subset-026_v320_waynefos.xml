	>The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: Structure of an MA):
	a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to which the train is authorised to move.
	b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; when the target speed is not zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA). This target speed can be time limited.
	c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the EOA that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.
	d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined time.
	e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity of the EOA, when the target speed is zero. One release speed can be associated
	with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section Error! Reference source not found.).
	f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.
	- A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is called the Section time-out.
	- In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.</Paragraph>

	b) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.
	c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority.

	>For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to preprogram the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.</Paragraph>

All the energy added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion.

	b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4);
	c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2);
	d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time-out (3.8.4.4.2) ;
	e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2);
	f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);
	g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.5.2);
	h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;
	i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;
	j) the train category, axle load category, loading gauge or traction system is changed and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ;
	k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;
	l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.7)
	m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and no linking is used onboard and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.4.4.2)

	>Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to 0s and 2 s, the locking will remain until the target speed monitoring is left, even if the train speed comes below the target speed. This avoids &quot;jumping&quot; indications. It also makes it possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid emergency brake.</Paragraph>

	>Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first considering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled).

	>Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes in which this information is otherwise useless.</Paragraph>

	>Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be decoded, the information &quot;Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction&quot; is only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly read, the information &quot;Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction&quot;, if received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need not to be referred to in the following tables.</Paragraph>

	>Procedures
	A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph
	id="5.3.2.2"
	type="DEFINITION"
	scope="OBU_AND_TRACK"
	>Entities
	The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i.e. the entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph
	id="5.3.2.3"
	type="DEFINITION"
	scope="OBU_AND_TRACK"
	>States
	States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not completely satisfied.
	Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.
	Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force branching in states.</Paragraph>

	type="DEFINITION"
	scope="OBU_AND_TRACK"
	bl="3.1.0"
	>Transitions
	Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time. When a transition refers to a driver&apos;s selection, it means that the conditions to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.</Paragraph>

	>For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an EoA can be required in degraded situations, e.g.
	- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable (e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).
	- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the interface between RBCs is unavailable).
	- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).
	- In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection with the interlocking)
	- In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route cannot be set)

	>Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.</Paragraph>
